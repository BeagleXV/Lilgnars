# Lil Gnars in Action!

Here’s a look at some of our recent events that brought smiles, new friendships, and awesome skate sessions to kids:

## Rio de Janeiro Skate Class

We kicked off a class at one of Rio’s popular skate spots, introducing kids to the fundamentals and getting them on their boards for the first time. Every skater left with new skills and a full lunch.

## Rita Lee Park Session

An exciting session at Rita Lee Park brought together kids from the area to skate, learn, and grow in confidence. It was all about community, connection, and carving those first lines—plus, every kid enjoyed a well-deserved lunch to power through the day.

## BBQ and Skate Bash

Our biggest event yet! We wrapped up an epic skate class with a BBQ, inviting kids and families to join in. It was all about having fun, sharing food, and celebrating the progress of our young skaters.

We’re just getting started! Stay tuned for future events, and come be a part of our next Lil Gnars adventure.
