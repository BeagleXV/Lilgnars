# About Lil Gnars

At Lil Gnars, we’re here to break boundaries and bring skateboarding to kids from all walks of life. Our mission? To inspire young skaters, offer free classes, and provide opportunities for every child to learn, grow, and skate with heart. Through skate, we’re building a supportive community where kids gain confidence, make friends, and discover the thrill of the ride.

With each class, kids not only learn skills on the board but also earn rewards like a chance to win their own skateboard, thanks to the support of our amazing partners. We also make sure every kid gets a full lunch to fuel their energy, so they can focus on what matters: having fun and learning something new.
